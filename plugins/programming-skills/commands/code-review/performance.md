# Performance Code Review

Please perform a comprehensive performance analysis of the following code:

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

Focus on:

## 1. Algorithmic Complexity
- Identify time complexity (Big O notation) of key operations
- Identify space complexity issues
- Are there more efficient algorithms or data structures?
- Look for nested loops, redundant calculations

## 2. Memory Management
- Are there memory leaks or unnecessary allocations?
- Can objects be reused or pooled?
- Are large objects held in memory unnecessarily?
- Is garbage collection pressure minimized?

## 3. I/O Operations
- Are I/O operations batched or optimized?
- Can operations be done asynchronously?
- Are there unnecessary file reads/writes?
- Is caching used effectively?

## 4. Database & Query Performance
- Are queries optimized with proper indexes?
- Is there N+1 query problem?
- Are connections pooled?
- Can queries be batched or consolidated?

## 5. Rendering & UI Performance
- Are unnecessary re-renders happening?
- Is virtual scrolling used for long lists?
- Are expensive operations memoized?
- Is lazy loading implemented where appropriate?

## 6. Network Performance
- Are API calls optimized and batched?
- Is data prefetching used?
- Are responses properly cached?
- Is compression enabled?

## 7. Code Patterns
- Are there premature optimizations?
- Is code clarity sacrificed unnecessarily?
- Are there blocking operations in hot paths?

Provide:
1. **Critical Issues**: Performance bottlenecks causing significant problems
2. **High Priority**: Substantial performance improvements
3. **Medium Priority**: Moderate optimizations
4. **Low Priority**: Minor refinements
5. **Code Examples**: Show optimized alternatives with performance comparisons

For each issue, explain:
- What the performance problem is
- Why it's inefficient
- Expected performance impact
- How to optimize it
- Benchmarks or measurements where relevant
