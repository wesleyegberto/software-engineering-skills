# Security Code Review

Please perform a comprehensive security analysis of the following code:

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

Focus on:

## 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- Are all user inputs properly validated?
- Is input sanitized before use in queries, commands, or rendering?
- Are there risks of injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command injection)?

## 2. Authentication & Authorization
- Are authentication mechanisms secure?
- Is authorization properly enforced?
- Are credentials handled securely?
- Is session management secure?

## 3. Data Protection
- Is sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit?
- Are secrets and API keys properly managed?
- Is PII (Personally Identifiable Information) handled correctly?

## 4. Common Vulnerabilities
- Check for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Look for race conditions and TOCTOU issues
- Identify potential buffer overflows or memory issues
- Check for insecure dependencies

## 5. Error Handling & Logging
- Are errors handled without exposing sensitive information?
- Is logging done securely without leaking secrets?
- Are stack traces exposed in production?

## 6. Access Control
- Are file permissions appropriate?
- Is path traversal prevented?
- Are resources properly scoped and isolated?

Provide:
1. **Critical Issues**: Vulnerabilities that must be fixed immediately
2. **High Priority**: Significant security concerns
3. **Medium Priority**: Security improvements
4. **Best Practices**: General security recommendations
5. **Code Examples**: Show secure alternatives for each issue

For each issue, explain:
- What the vulnerability is
- Why it's dangerous
- How to fix it
- Example of secure code
