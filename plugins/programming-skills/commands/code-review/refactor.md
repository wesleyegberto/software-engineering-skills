# Code Refactoring Suggestions

Please analyze the following code and provide refactoring recommendations:

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

Focus on:

## 1. Code Smells
Identify and suggest fixes for:
- Long methods/functions (>20-30 lines)
- Long parameter lists (>3-4 parameters)
- Duplicated code
- Large classes/modules
- Primitive obsession
- Feature envy
- Data clumps
- Switch/conditional complexity

## 2. Design Patterns
Suggest appropriate design patterns:
- Can Strategy pattern replace conditionals?
- Would Factory pattern improve object creation?
- Is Observer pattern needed for events?
- Should Decorator pattern be used?
- Would Adapter pattern help integration?
- Is Singleton appropriate (or anti-pattern)?

## 3. Simplification Opportunities
- Can complex conditionals be simplified?
- Are there opportunities to use guard clauses?
- Can nested structures be flattened?
- Should temporary variables be eliminated?
- Can expression complexity be reduced?

## 4. Extract & Compose
- Methods that should be extracted
- Classes that should be split
- Modules that should be separated
- Utilities that should be shared
- Constants that should be defined

## 5. Naming Improvements
- Variables with unclear names
- Functions that don't describe what they do
- Classes with vague or misleading names
- Naming inconsistencies

## 6. Dependency Management
- Dependencies that should be inverted
- Coupling that should be reduced
- Cohesion that should be improved
- Circular dependencies to eliminate

## 7. Modern Code Practices
- Legacy patterns to modernize
- Functional programming opportunities
- Async/await over callbacks
- Modern syntax improvements
- Type safety enhancements

## 8. Architecture Improvements
- Layer violations to fix
- Separation of concerns issues
- API design improvements
- State management enhancements

Provide:
1. **High Impact Refactorings**: Most valuable changes
2. **Medium Impact**: Worthwhile improvements
3. **Low Impact**: Polish and minor enhancements
4. **Before/After Examples**: Show concrete refactoring steps
5. **Step-by-Step Guide**: Safe refactoring sequence
6. **Tests to Write**: What to test before/during refactoring

For each refactoring, explain:
- What needs to change
- Why it's beneficial
- How to refactor safely
- What tests to have in place
- Expected improvement in maintainability
